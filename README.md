# Introduction 
Luganda is a Low Resource Language so there no pretrained model for automatic-speech-recognition for it. In this project, I fine tuned openai's whisper-small model for speech recognition in Luganda using swahili as the base language since swahili is related to luganda and the model was trained on swahili dataset
